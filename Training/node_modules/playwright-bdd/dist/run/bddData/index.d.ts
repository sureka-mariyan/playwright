/**
 * Bdd data is a special annotation with test meta data, needed for Cucumber reporting.
 *
 * Previously we used attachment for that, but annotation is better:
 * it allows to update data synchronously, while attachment needs
 * to be asynchronously attached in teardown phase that may not run.
 * See: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/30175
