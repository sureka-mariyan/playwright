Run [BDD](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) runner.

> Inspired by the issue in the Playwright repo [microsoft/playwright#11975](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11975)

> [!TIP]
> Playwright-bdd **v6** is out! Check out [Cucumber reporters](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/reporters/cucumber) and share your feedback 

## Why Playwright runner?
Both [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) have their own test runners. 
You can use CucumberJS runner with [Playwright as a library](https://medium.com/@manabie/how-to-use-playwright-in-cucumberjs-f8ee5b89bccc) to test BDD scenarios.
This package offers **an alternative way**: convert BDD scenarios into Playwright tests and run them with Playwright runner as usual. 
Such approach brings all the benefits of Playwright runner:

* Automatic browser initialization and cleanup
* Auto-capture of screenshots, videos and traces
* Parallelization with sharding
* Auto-waiting of page elements
* Out-of-box visual comparison testing
* Power of Playwright fixtures
* [...a lot more](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#key-differences)

## Extras
Some features were developed in `playwright-bdd` on top of Playwright and BDD approaches:

* [Decorator steps](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/decorators)
* [Special tags](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/special-tags)
* [Calling step from step](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/playwright-style?id=call-step-from-step)
